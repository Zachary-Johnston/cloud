Interactive. Responsive.

Make sure to scroll to see everything on every page.

Check out hover effects.

Javascript was used to navigate between pages. Also, clicking the logos at either the top or bottom of the pages take you back to home (predictable design).

It's pretty slow, so give it time to load.


All requirements met:
Docker – two containers with Pyramid Web Server and MySQL Database (a third container with a rest server was added for use)
HTML – it is all my code
CSS – I did not use a framework from the web, and I didn't use the one from class (I wrote it myself).
Javascript – I didn't steal any JS from the web.
Digital Ocean – was deployed on Digital Ocean.
Call to action - present on every page, and the info is successfully stored in agile_db

All presentation requirements met:
The top page clearly and distinctly defines my product -- and my brand. I shot for minimalism, since our product is about minimalism, convenience, and simplicity. This page gives a brief overview of the product -- with messaging that explains product benefits to my audience.
A secondary pages for "product features" -- present and navigatable from landing page.
An "about us" page -- present and it details who my team is, and what we stand for.
A pricing page for each element of your pricing model -- present.
A "sign-up" page where users can register for your mailing list -- present.
